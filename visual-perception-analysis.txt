require visual perception systems (cameras, video feeds, or 3D sensors).

Overall Market Breakdown:
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): $1.36B
- Visual Perception-Enabled Market: $681.5M (~50%)

This analysis specifically tracks eligibility based on visual/camera systems,
as GI's technology requires visual perception data to effectively plug into
robotic systems.

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. WAREHOUSE FORKLIFTS ARE THE PRIMARY BOTTLENECK
   The $400M warehouse forklift market has only 7% eligibility due to low
   adoption of camera-equipped telematics systems. Of 16M forklifts globally,
   only 1.1M have video feeds (Berg Insight data).

   Impact: This single subsector reduces overall mobile ground vehicle
   eligibility from ~50% to 25%.


2. MANIPULATION SYSTEMS SHOW HIGHEST VISUAL PERCEPTION ADOPTION
   90% of the $360M manipulation market is eligible because:
   - Pick-and-place inherently requires vision for unstructured environments
   - Assembly tasks need camera-based part alignment and QC
   - Even welding robots increasingly use vision for seam tracking

   Source: IFR data on industrial robot deployments, referenced in Market
   Sizing Math.pdf and GI Enterprise Case Study.pdf


3. AERIAL SYSTEMS HAVE MODERATE ELIGIBILITY (70%)
   While drones naturally incorporate cameras, some applications (agricultural
   spraying, basic GPS waypoint delivery) don't require the visual perception
   sophistication needed for GI's technology.

   Infrastructure inspection shows highest eligibility at 90% due to inherent
   need for visual defect detection.


4. ELIGIBILITY TRACKS VISUAL/CAMERA SYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY
   This analysis focuses on robots with:
   - Camera feeds (RGB, thermal, multispectral)
   - 3D sensors (LiDAR, structured light, stereo vision)
   - Video telemetry systems

   Simple encoders, GPS, or RFID-only systems are excluded as they lack the
   visual perception data GI requires for effective deployment.


METHODOLOGY NOTES
================================================================================

Eligibility rates are based on:
1. Install base data from Berg Insight (telematics), IFR (industrial robots),
   Interact Analysis (warehouse automation)
2. Technology adoption rates for camera/sensor systems
3. Use case requirements for visual perception (structured vs. unstructured
   environments)

All calculations are conservative estimates based on current market data as
of the analysis date. Future adoption of visual perception systems will likely
increase eligibility rates, particularly in the warehouse forklift segment as
telematics with cameras becomes more standard.
