VISUAL PERCEPTION SYSTEM ADOPTION ACROSS ENTERPRISE ROBOTICS APPLICATIONS
Executive Summary - Based on 2024-2025 Market Research
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Analysis of visual perception system (camera, LiDAR, 3D sensor) adoption across
General Intuition's target enterprise applications reveals significant variance
by category. Overall market-weighted adoption ranges from 15-85% depending on
application, with manipulation systems showing highest adoption and material
handling equipment showing lowest current penetration despite rapid growth.


CATEGORY 1: WAREHOUSE & MATERIAL HANDLING
================================================================================

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)
--------------------------------
Adoption Rate: 85-90%

• LiDAR-based navigation: 44.1% market share in 2024 [1]
• Vision-based systems: Growing at 21.22% CAGR, rapidly gaining share [1]
• Hardware (sensors/cameras): $1.4 billion market in 2024 [1]
• Combined visual perception adoption: ~85-90% (LiDAR + vision systems)

Key Finding: AMRs inherently require visual perception for autonomous navigation.
Most modern systems use either LiDAR SLAM, vision-based navigation, or hybrid
approaches. Only legacy guided-wire systems lack visual perception.

Warehouse Forklifts
-------------------
Adoption Rate: 10-15% (estimated)

• Forklift 360° camera market: $0.95 billion in 2026, up from $0.81B in 2025 [2]
• Growth rate: 18.2% CAGR, indicating emerging technology status [2]
• Forklift telematics market: $2.17-2.45 billion in 2024 [3]
• Total forklift market: $91.19 billion in 2025 [4]

Calculation: Camera market ($0.95B) ÷ Total market ($91B) ≈ 1% of revenue
However, cameras concentrate on heavy-duty warehouse forklifts in high-traffic
environments. Adjusting for this segment yields ~10-15% penetration estimate.

Key Finding: Camera systems are "increasingly becoming standard" but face
barriers including "high initial investment costs" and are primarily adopted by
larger operations. [5]

WEIGHTED AVERAGE ESTIMATE
================================================================================

Based on market size data and adoption rates across categories:

• HIGH ADOPTION SEGMENTS (>70%): Manipulation systems, advanced drones, AMRs,
  delivery robots
  Combined market share: ~35-40% of total addressable market

• MEDIUM ADOPTION SEGMENTS (40-70%): General industrial robots, agricultural
  drones, material handling automation
  Combined market share: ~25-30% of total addressable market

• LOW ADOPTION SEGMENTS (<40%): Warehouse forklifts, construction equipment,
  mid-size agricultural operations
  Combined market share: ~30-40% of total addressable market

OVERALL ESTIMATED ADOPTION: 50-60%

This represents machines currently equipped with visual perception systems
(cameras, LiDAR, 3D sensors) suitable for AI policy deployment across GI's
target enterprise applications.


KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. APPLICATION CRITICALITY DRIVES ADOPTION
   Applications where visual perception is inherent to core function (inspection
   drones, bin picking, autonomous navigation) show 85-100% adoption. Applications
   where it's a safety/efficiency enhancement (forklifts, construction equipment)
   show 10-50% adoption.

2. WAREHOUSE FORKLIFTS REPRESENT LARGEST LOW-ADOPTION SEGMENT
   Despite $91B total market and rapid camera system growth (18.2% CAGR), current
   penetration remains 10-15%. This represents significant opportunity as safety
   regulations and automation trends drive adoption.

3. MANIPULATION SYSTEMS ARE MOST MATURE
   Industrial robots show 70-75% overall adoption, with 93% adoption in advanced
   "digital lighthouse" factories. Unstructured pick-and-place applications
   approach 85% as vision becomes mainstream.

4. FARM SIZE CREATES ADOPTION DIVIDE IN AGRICULTURE
   Large farms (>1,000 hectares): 70% GNSS adoption, 86% autosteer
   Medium farms: 52% GNSS adoption, 30-60% sensor adoption
   This creates a tiered market where visual perception concentrates in
   commercial-scale operations.

5. RAPID GROWTH IN EMERGING CATEGORIES
   - Forklift cameras: 18.2% CAGR
   - Vision-guided AMRs: 21.22% CAGR
   - Inspection drones: 21.66% CAGR
   - Autonomous construction equipment: 9.6% CAGR

   These growth rates indicate visual perception adoption will increase
   significantly over 2025-2030, particularly as costs decline and regulations
   evolve.


METHODOLOGY & LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

Data Sources:
This analysis aggregates 2024-2025 market research reports from Grand View
Research, Markets and Markets, GM Insights, Fortune Business Insights, Mordor
Intelligence, Next MSC, SNS Insider, and government sources (U.S. GAO).

Approach:
- Market sizing data used to weight categories
- Adoption rates calculated from technology penetration statistics
- Where specific percentages unavailable, estimates derived from market growth
  rates, technology descriptions, and segment analysis
- "Visual perception" defined as: cameras (RGB/thermal/multispectral), LiDAR,
  3D structured light, stereo vision, or equivalent sensor systems

Limitations:
- Forklift camera penetration estimated from market ratios (specific install
  base percentage not available in public research)
- Construction equipment adoption ranges widely by equipment type and region
- Some reports measure different segments (e.g., 2D vs 3D vision systems) making
  direct comparisons challenging
- Regional variation (Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe) affects global
  averages


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Visual perception system adoption across GI's enterprise applications shows
strong bifurcation:

• READY NOW (70-100% adoption): Industrial manipulation, drones, AMRs, delivery
  robots - representing 35-40% of TAM

• EMERGING OPPORTUNITY (10-50% adoption): Forklifts, construction equipment,
  mid-size agriculture - representing 30-40% of TAM with rapid growth trajectories

Overall, approximately 50-60% of the addressable market currently has visual
perception capabilities suitable for AI policy deployment, with this percentage
increasing 5-10 percentage points annually based on observed growth rates.

The bifurcation creates two distinct go-to-market strategies:
1. Immediate deployment in high-adoption segments (manipulation, AMRs, drones)
2. Strategic positioning for emerging segments with 10-20% annual growth rates
